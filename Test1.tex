	\noindent\textbf{General Directions:}  Answer each question thoroughly.  Incorrect answers with work shown may receive partial credit, but unsubstantiated answers will receive NO CREDIT.  I do not want (decimal) approximations unless specifically asked for.  I want the exact numbers.  Justify all claims using calculus concepts (i.e., theorems, definitions, etc.).  I am looking for mathematical logic and reasoning.  Show all of your work!! Explain!  Explain!  Explain!  Graphing calculators are NOT allowed.
	
	\begin{questions}
		\question[25] Analyze the function $f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-9x+8}{\sqrt{x^4-2x^3+x^2}}$.  That is, state the domain, determine the intercepts, identify discontinuities and classify them as removable or non-removable, and determine all asymptotes of the function.

		\question[25] Analyze the function $g(x) = \begin{cases}\dfrac{1}{x+4} & x<-2 \\ 
				x^2 & -2 \leq x \leq 2 \\
				x+2 & 2<x<4 \\
				-\dfrac{2x}{x+7} & x \geq 4 \\
				 \end{cases}$.  That is, state the domain, determine the intercepts, identify discontinuities and classify them as removable or non-removable, and determine all asymptotes of the function.
