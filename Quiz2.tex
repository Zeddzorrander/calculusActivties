  \textbf{Quiz 2}\\
  \textbf{20 points} \\
  
  \noindent\textbf{Directions:}  Answer each question thoroughly.  Incorrect answers with work shown may receive partial credit, but unsubstantiated answers will receive NO CREDIT.  I do not want (decimal) approximations unless specifically asked for.  I want the exact numbers.  Justify all claims using calculus concepts (i.e., theorems, definitions, etc.).  I am looking for mathematical logic and reasoning.  Show all of your work!! Explain!  Explain!  Explain!  Four points will be dedicated to how you perform as a group.
